# Layout practices
Several web pages, mostly static, made from designs collected from the Internet.

The goal is to put into practice my knowledge of HTML, CSS and, to a lesser extent, DOM manipulation with Javascript.

Here I will try to translate the designs that I find interesting into web development code, to show how they would look if they were real websites.

For anyone who is viewing this site, I hope you find it enjoyable.
